An Isolette is an incubator for an Infant that provides controlled temperature, humidity, and oxygen. The purpose of the Isolette Thermostat is to maintain the air temperature of an Isolette within a desired range. If the temperature falls too far below or rises too far above the Desired Temperature Range, it activates an alarm to alert the Nurse.  Figure 1 shows the context diagram of the Isolette Thermostat.
